Welcome to your new Jekyll site! This site is powered by data generated from a GitHub Action.

Every time you push to the repository, the GitHub Action will run, generating a new CSV file with fresh data. This data is then used to render the beautiful cards on the home page.

## How it works

1. You push changes to your repository
2. GitHub Actions workflow runs automatically
3. The workflow script generates a new CSV file with data
4. Jekyll uses this CSV file to display the data on your site
5. Your site is automatically rebuilt and deployed

## Customize your site

To customize your site, you can:

- Edit the `_config.yml` file to change your site's title, description, and other settings
- Modify the CSS in `assets/css/main.scss` to change colors, fonts, and layout
- Create new posts in the `_posts` directory
- Edit the templates in the `_layouts` directory
